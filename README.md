# SQL-SCRIPTING-TOOL
This is a java-based desktop application that provides the user interface with a GUI to interact with the Java-derby database.

Technology: JAVA.

Database: java-derby.

## Benifits of using this Application:
1) It feels comfortable to use Graphical User Interface to perform  CRUD operations on java-derby database rather than command line.
2) It can generate Data Layer of any table just in one click.
3) Platform Independent as developed in java.
4) User dont have to worry about writing code for Data Layer again again for different applications.


## Getting Started.
Prerequisite: Java 8 or above, Java-derby.

Steps to use the Application:
## Step 1(Download jar and Extract it)
Download the [dowload.jar](https://github.com/SIDDHANTJOHARI/SQL-SCRIPTING-TOOL/blob/master/GUITOOL.jar) File.

Extract it anywhere you want to.

After Extracting this structure is created

/SQLGUITOOL.jar
  
/lib

/META-INF
  
## Step 2(Instantiate Java-derby Server)
In this step as I have include java-dery as prerequisites it means you have already had downloaded it.

Now Start the the server in the parent folder of your database.

For example:

If your project structure is /project/db then start the server inside the project folder.

## Step 3(Execute  the Application)

For Executing the Application write the following command.
```java 
java -jar SQLGUITOOL.jar

There are 4 section here.
#### 1. SQL Statement:-To fire SQL query on your database.
#### 2. Output:- In this section you will see out put of your executed statement.
#### 3. Error:- This Section will show error in your sql statement or error related to connection.
#### 4. Database Tables:- This section contains all the tables which is in your database.

Now you can fire any sql statement to perform operations on your database and you can also see the data of table by clicking on name of table in Database Tables Section.

### Now I will show you the best feature of this Application.
 It can generate datalayer for a table just in seconds.
 
 First of all you have to set RAD(Rapid Application Development Setting) to set the base package Name and the path where you want to generate data layer.
 
 Now you can select any of the table and click on Genrate DTO Button .woahh! whole Data Layer is generated in the folder you have set in Rad Settings.
 
 For the better Understanding you can watch this video.
